# MLOps Implementation Plan

## 1. Containerization with Docker

### Base Image Structure
```dockerfile
# Base image for development
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Development image with Jupyter
FROM base as dev
RUN pip install jupyter notebook

# Production image
FROM base as prod
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Container Strategy
- Development container with hot-reload for local development
- Production container optimized for inference
- Separate containers for training and serving

## 2. Experiment Tracking with MLflow

### Implementation Details
1. Model Registry
   - Track model versions
   - Store model artifacts
   - Maintain model lineage

2. Experiment Tracking
   - Log hyperparameters
   - Track metrics
   - Visualize results

3. Model Serving
   - Serve models via MLflow Model Registry
   - Version control for models
   - A/B testing capability

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Code Quality
   - Linting (flake8)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Unit tests (pytest)

2. Model Training
   - Automated training on schedule
   - Model validation
   - Performance testing

3. Deployment
   - Container build
   - Model deployment
   - API deployment

## 4. Monitoring and Logging

### Metrics to Track
1. Model Performance
   - Prediction accuracy
   - Feature importance
   - Data drift detection

2. System Metrics
   - API response time
   - Resource utilization
   - Error rates

### Logging Strategy
- Structured logging with JSON format
- Centralized log management
- Alert system for anomalies

## 5. Data Pipeline

### ETL Process
1. Data Collection
   - Automated data fetching
   - Data validation
   - Storage in S3/cloud storage

2. Feature Engineering
   - Automated feature computation
   - Feature validation
   - Feature store implementation

3. Model Training
   - Automated retraining
   - Model validation
   - Performance monitoring

## 6. Infrastructure Requirements

### Development
- Local development environment
- Docker Compose for services
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis

### Production
- Kubernetes cluster
- Load balancer
- Auto-scaling configuration
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana)

## 7. Security Considerations

1. Data Security
   - Encrypted data storage
   - Secure API endpoints
   - Access control

2. Model Security
   - Model versioning
   - Access control
   - Audit logging
