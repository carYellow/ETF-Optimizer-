# MLOps Plan for Stock Prediction System

## 1. Containerization with Docker

Docker will provide a consistent environment for development, testing, and production:

- **Base Image**: Python 3.10 with scientific computing packages  
- **Multiple Docker Images**:
  - Development image with additional debugging tools  
  - Training image optimized for model training workloads  
  - Inference image (lightweight) for the API service  
  - Data processing image for feature engineering pipeline  
- **Docker Compose**: For local development to orchestrate multiple services  
- **Docker Volumes**: To persist model artifacts, datasets, and logs  

## 2. Experiment Tracking with MLflow

MLflow will help track experiments, manage model versions, and deploy models:

- **Experiment Tracking**: Log hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts  
- **Model Registry**: Version control for trained models with promotion workflows (staging â†’ production)  
- **Model Serving**: Deploy models directly from the registry  
- **Parameter Optimization**: Integration with hyperparameter tuning libraries  
- **Model Comparison**: Dashboard for comparing different model versions and their performance  

## 3. Data Pipeline with Dagster

Dagster will orchestrate the entire workflow as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):

- **Data Ingestion**: Daily fetch of stock data from Yahoo Finance  
- **Feature Engineering**: Generate features from OHLCV data  
- **Model Training**: Regular retraining schedule with new data  
- **Model Evaluation**: Validation against holdout sets  
- **Model Deployment**: Automatic deployment of models that meet quality thresholds  
- **Monitoring**: Track data drift and model performance in production  

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration:
  - Run tests on code changes  
  - Build and push Docker images  
  - Deploy infrastructure changes  
- **ArgoCD/Flux**: For continuous deployment to Kubernetes (if using k8s)  

## 5. Infrastructure as Code

- **Terraform**: To provision cloud resources (EC2/GCP/Azure)  
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: For container orchestration in production  
- **Helm Charts**: For packaging and deploying the application  

## 6. Monitoring and Observability

- **Prometheus**: For metrics collection  
- **Grafana**: For visualization dashboards  
- **ELK Stack**: For log aggregation and search  
- **Alerts**: For model drift, prediction quality decline, and system health  

## 7. Data and Model Versioning

- **DVC**: For versioning large datasets  
- **Model Registry**: For versioning models  
- **Feature Store**: To manage feature computation and serving  

## 8. Model Serving

- **FastAPI**: For the prediction service  
- **Load Balancing**: For high availability  
- **Caching**: For frequently requested predictions  
- **Request/Response Logging**: For debugging and auditing  

## 9. Security and Compliance

- **Secret Management**: Using Vault or cloud-native solutions  
- **HTTPS**: For all API endpoints  
- **Authentication and Authorization**: For secure access  
- **Audit Logs**: For compliance and debugging  

## 10. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: For individual components  
- **Integration Tests**: For combined workflows  
- **A/B Testing Framework**: For model comparisons  
- **Shadow Deployment**: For new models before full rollout
