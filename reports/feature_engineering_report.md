## 3. Feature Engineering Recommendations
### Features to Add:
- **Market Microstructure**: Bid-ask spread, order flow imbalance
- **Cross-sectional**: Stock vs sector performance, relative strength
- **Alternative Data**: Sentiment scores, news volume
- **Macroeconomic**: Interest rates, VIX, dollar index
- **Options-based**: Implied volatility, put-call ratio

### Feature Transformations:
- Apply log transformation to skewed features
- Create interaction terms for top features
- Add polynomial features for non-linear relationships
- Implement regime-based features (bull/bear market indicators)
