# Model Training Automation Implementation

## Solution Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive model training automation system with the following components:

1. **Script Automation**: 
   - Created `run_model_experiments.py` to run train_models.py across different configurations
   - Automated training with various model types (excluding Random Forest due to performance)
   - Implemented all requested train/test split strategies

2. **Feature Tracking**:
   - Modified `train_models.py` to save extracted features to disk
   - Created `feature_tracker.py` to log features, importance scores, and selection rationale
   - Added tracking across all training runs

3. **Traceability & Reporting**:
   - Implemented comprehensive logging for each training session
   - Created `generate_consolidated_report.py` to produce comparative reports
   - Added visualization and analysis components

```

## Key Features

1. **Experiment Management**:
   - Run multiple model types in parallel
   - Test various train/test split strategies
   - Track and compare performance metrics

2. **Feature Intelligence**:
   - Save and analyze important features
   - Track feature selection rationale
   - Provide insights into feature performance

3. **Comprehensive Reporting**:
   - Generate HTML and Markdown reports
   - Compare model performance across configurations
   - Visualize feature importance and model metrics

## How To Use

### Basic Usage:

```bash
# Run the complete pipeline with default settings
python scripts/run_model_pipeline.py

# Run a quick test with minimal configuration
python scripts/run_model_pipeline.py --quick_run

# Generate reports only (skip training)
python scripts/run_model_pipeline.py --skip_training
```

### Advanced Usage:

```bash
# Specify which models to train
python scripts/run_model_pipeline.py --models xgboost lightgbm

# Specify which split methods to use
python scripts/run_model_pipeline.py --splits temporal event_aware

# Control hyperparameter optimization
python scripts/run_model_pipeline.py --optimization optuna --n_trials 50
```

## Output and Reports

The system generates several types of reports:

1. **Experiment Results**: Stored in `reports/experiment_results/`
2. **Feature Data**: Stored in `reports/feature_data/`
3. **Consolidated Reports**: Stored in `reports/consolidated_reports/`

The final report includes:
- Performance comparison across models and splits
- Best-performing configurations
- Feature importance analysis
- Actionable insights and recommendations

## Next Steps

The system is ready to use. To get started:

1. Run a quick test to verify functionality:
   ```bash
   python scripts/quick_test.py
   ```

2. Run the full pipeline with your preferred configuration:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_model_pipeline.py
   ```

3. Review the generated reports in the reports directory
